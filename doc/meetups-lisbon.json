Through a radical understanding and potent investigation of the human mind, we promote a deep and solid inquiry on thinking in regard to psychological and social intelligent evolution detached from all conditionings. The less confused a mind is, the more intelligent that mind becomes. Our aim is to wholly understand and therefore decrease the level of psychological confusion within a single individual and within communities to improve the quality of life both subjectively and globally. </p>\n<blockquote> \n <p><b>This Meetup Group is For people who are interested in:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p> \n <p>·&nbsp; The mind, critical thinking, psychology, sociology, anthropology, neurology and history (especially if you’re a student or a professor in these fields)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p> \n <p>·&nbsp; Understanding the problem and questioning it rather than easy answers and quick fix solutions, meta-cognition and cognitive science<br></p> \n <p>·&nbsp; Understanding abuse and depression, how they stem from beliefs, and how our beliefs abuse us, especially religious, spiritual and new age ones&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p> \n <p>·&nbsp; Exploring negligence and unnecessary damage to our species because of our belief systems rather than just damage control&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p> \n <p>&nbsp;·&nbsp; Those who can see how condoned beliefs create problems and are tired of exploiters and being exploited with religion, spirituality, pseudo science, society and beliefs in general <br></p> \n</blockquote>\n<p><b>This Meetup Group / EOF Project is NOT:</b> </p>\n<p>•&nbsp; NOT for people who are heavily involved in beliefs of any kind, especially religious or spiritual beliefs, unless they are willing to have all these ideologies challenged</p>\n<p> •&nbsp; NOT a political movement, new lifestyle, a way to be more successful, a quick fix feel good motivational “solution”, an escape from problems, a religion, landmark, a sect, an ideological vision of existence, brainwashing, a spiritual school, NLP, Philosophy, a motivational tool, a hierarchical structure, a lucrative entity, an initiative, a sales pitch, aimed to teach, or to suggest any doctrine or rules of new identities &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>\n<p><b>Topics </b></p>\n<p>o&nbsp; What does it mean to have a clear mind?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></p>\n<p>o&nbsp; Why is confusion predominant in society and in our psychology and why does irrationality seem to be always more alluring than rational thinking?</p>\n<p>o&nbsp; Why are we the most intelligent yet the most cognitively disturbed of all the species?</p>\n<p>o&nbsp; Why is love linked to violence, wherever there is love there is violence? </p>\n<p>o&nbsp; Why do we strive for and preach about peace but are unable to achieve it psychologically first then externally? </p>\n<p>o&nbsp; Why are we slaves to our beliefs, identity, answers and the truth?

He has an extensive background in Political Science, Sociology and Psychology. He founded the EOF Project as a response to the flawed systems and structures that dampen and contaminates our ability to think, resulting in psychological suffering and many of the world’s problems. </p>\n<p>After becoming familiar with the confusing contradictions embedded within the decaying structures of society, it became important for him to explain how all structures, whether belief, literal, or physical structures springing from these thought-forms, fragment and warp our understandings of reality. The ramifications are that our personal or collective crises seem to “come out of nowhere” and our psychological problems are suppressed. All our attempts to cling to structure itself without understanding why the structure was erected in the first place, will only increase the psychological tension for all involved, and at best, lead to a false sense of progress. </p>\n<p>Diego’s passion motivated him to write numerous articles for some prominent members of the psychological community, who now have him writing and sharing his observations with the U.N. In just one year he has written a 12 book series called Orientations. He is adept at anticipating and understanding what should be some of humanity’s greatest concerns: the health of our mind, for example, and the legacies we will leave future generations. </p>\n<p>diego@eofproject.org <br> http:endoffear.weebly.com or <a href=\""http://eofproject.org\"" class=\""linkified\"">http://eofproject.org</a> </p>\n<p><b>About Jessica </b></p>\n<p>Jessica Schab, originally from Vancouver, Canada is co-founder of the EOF Project and is personally responsible for connecting the vision of the foundation to a wider audience. Formerly a spiritual speaker for 10 years. Jessica renounced her new age metaphysical path when she started to see how this route was causing psychological harm and mental instability. All while being passed off as helping people, it is actually doing harm instead of bringing about a clear mind while creating and perpetuating dangerous traps. With this understanding Jessica feels strongly compelled to speak out on this subject with the intention of bringing awareness and encouraging a sense of responsibility to share her story and inform others. Jessica is a prolific writer, speaker and presenter offering an inside look at confusion and the EOF Project as she includes behind the scenes memoirs of what it is like to dismantle. She offers a fresh perspective to the project and is in charge of directing the various avenues that bring life to the project initiatives. She is known for her empathic and sensitive approach and excels in connecting with others, giving wings to the vision of the project.</p>\n<p><a href=\""mailto:jessica@eofproject.org\"">jessica@eofproject.org</a>&nbsp; <br> <a href=\""http://www.jessicamystic.com\"">http://www.jessicamystic.com</a> or&nbsp; <a href=\""http://eofproject.org/\"">http://eofproject.org/</a></p>"",""link"":""http://www.meetup.com/Lisbon-EOF-Project/"",""start_date"":null,""end_date"":null,""created_at"":""2015-09-01T23:11:59.46822"",""updated_at"":""2015-09-01T23:11:59.46822"",""external_id"":""18214921"",""external_image"":""http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/3/5/d/2/thumb_434593778.jpeg"",""source_site"":1,""disabled"":false}"

"{""id"":343,""name"":""Learn Portuguese in Lisbon with PortugueseConnection Meetup"",""description"":""<p>In 2008, I, Prof. Joana Paiva (Studies Director), graduated in Portuguese and English Studies. After my graduation, I was having second thoughts about my future. I’d heard so many stories about the issues of being a teacher. Everyone was talking about “thousands of unemployed teachers”, “the government is shutting down schools around the country”, “it´s time to emigrate”, and so on. But I had a problem. I was deeply in love with my language and my country. Teaching my language to others was my dream. Therefore, I wasn’t ready to turn my back and give up. Besides, how could I miss the ocean, the sunny days, the smell of fresh fish, the delicious and breath-taking Portuguese pastry, people smiling at each other and commenting on the weather in the metro, walking around the streets with that soft breeze on your face, leaving work and sitting in a café with my favourite newspaper and hearing people talking about the last football match or complaining about their rheumatoid arthritis. Small things actually matter. So, after five years teaching Portuguese for Foreigners for different schools and companies in Porto, I decided to follow my dream and open my own Portuguese Language School, this time in Lisbon. This project is the result of a constant idea that I had in mind: to create a school focused on teaching Portuguese for Foreigners but with a new concept and a different approach. A student’s experience of a lifetime. As Fernando Pessoa says \""Deus quer, o homem sonha, a obra nasce\"" (God wills, the man dreams and the work is born). And here it is: The Portuguese Connection Language School Project.</p>"",""link"":""http://www.meetup.com/Learn-Portuguese-in-Lisbon-with-PortugueseConnection-Meetup/"",""start_date"":null,""end_date"":null,""created_at"":""2015-09-01T23:11:59.50467"",""updated_at"":""2015-09-01T23:11:59.50467"",""external_id"":""18509705"",""external_image"":""http://photos2.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/2/0/a/4/thumb_435368356.jpeg"",""source_site"":1,""disabled"":false}"
